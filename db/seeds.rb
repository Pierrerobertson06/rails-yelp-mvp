# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# coco = Restaurant.create!(name: "coco", address: "paris, 75010", category: "french")
# beaurivage = Restaurant.create!(name: "beaurivage", address: "lausanne, 1000", category: "italian")
# annesophie = Restaurant.create!(name: "annesophie", address: "ours, 1060", category: "chinese")
